    <h2>
        [Verse 1]
    </h2>
    <h3>
        I got two strong arms,<br>
        Blessings of Babylon,<br>
        Time to carry on,<br>
        And try for sins and false alarms,<br>
        So, to America, the brave,<br>
        Wise men save,<br>
    </h3>
    <h2>
        [Chorus]
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground,<br>
        Where an old man of Aran goes around and around,<br>
        And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night,<br>
        For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right,<br>
        Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground,<br>
        Where an old man of Aran goes around and around,<br>
        And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night,<br>
        For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right,<br>
        He'll never, never fight over you,
        (x2)
    </h3>
    <h2>
        [Verse 2]
    </h2>
    <h3>
        I got plans for us,<br>
        Nights in the scullery,<br>
        And days instead of me,<br>
        I only know what to discuss,<br>
        Oh, for anything, but light,<br>
        Wise men fighting over you,<br>
        It's not me you see,<br>
        Pieces of valentine,<br>
        With just a song of mine,<br>
        To keep from burning history,<br>
        Seasons of gasoline and gold,<br>
        Wise men fold,<br>
    </h3>
    <h2>
        [Chorus]
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground,<br>
        Where an old man of Aran goes around and around,<br>
        And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night,<br>
        For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right,<br>
        Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground,<br>
        Where an old man of Aran goes around and around,<br>
        And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night,<br>

    <h3>
        I got time to kill,<br>
        Sly looks in corridors,<br>
        Without a plan of yours,<br>
        A blackbird sings on bluebird hill,<br>
        Thanks to the calling of the wild,<br>
        Wise mens' child,<br>
    </h3>
